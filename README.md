# Cozy
A little package to create a more cozy working environment for Pharo.

It is based on Pharo-scripts from Cyril Ferlicot and probably QuickAccess from Torsten Bergman (I do not know since
I started from phaor-scripts). 

Cozy supports
- iceberg configuration via files saved in your settings
- scan of your github repo to populate iceberg in one click
- many cool scripts
- a superb new them called day at the beach

Next version should 
- support modular definition of script (instead in a single class because relying on protocols does not work with
class extensions.
- a way to manage (as Pharo-scripts all) the settings folder in github.
- smoother theme integration.
